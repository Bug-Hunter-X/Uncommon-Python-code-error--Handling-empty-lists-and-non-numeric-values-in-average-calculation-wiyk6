This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Python code that involves handling empty lists and lists with non-numeric values when calculating averages. The `bug.py` file contains the original code with the error, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected and improved version. The error in the original code can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.  The solution involves robust error handling and type checking to prevent these issues.
